Assignment Constents:
-"track_team_tuples.py"
    Renamed for later use, same as "user_tuples_ect.py"

-For "user_numeric_lists" see "track_km.py"
    The code would have been enromous and required more time to run and debug, so I moved wrote it seperatly.

-"vocab_string_list1.py"
    Renamed forlater use, same as "user_string_list.py"

    See "rivals_2023.txt" for article mined.

"Tracks_km.txt" and "fastest_lap_rec.text" added as references to store total data for lists and code.
It's easier to keep track of the details this way.
